               We have two types of queue management which are: Organisation management and Small business.
               Qtree helps organisations to manage bulk queue and also provides small businesses functions that enables them to manage queue  for free.
               The main differences between organisations and small businesses or individual queue is that,
               Organisations queue data is stored for analysis while small business data can only last for a day.
               Note: when registering the default type of queue management is small business. To upgrade to Organisation management you can visit your dashboard.
               Note that by the time writing this guide Organisation management is not available.

               Queue operates in three different ways which are:
               Done,Hold,Next. Once a user is selected from a queue, the user gets notified immediately. This way we can provide queue discipline.
               And also once  a user is done in a queue or deleted from a queue the users status will changed to done and deleted respectively.
               2. User can leave a  queue by click on request leave on his/her mobile phone. When a user clicks on request leave, he/she would be added to reneging list.
